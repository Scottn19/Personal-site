<p>Something about me is that I absolutley love reading. I lose myself in books and sometimes startling amounts of time have past. Playing games is another fun pastime of mine, I love the cinematics and stories told inside games. Typically the more lore and story a game has to it, the more likely I am to enjoy it. </p>
